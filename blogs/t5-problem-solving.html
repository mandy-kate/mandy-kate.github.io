                    <h4>What was a problem you solved this week in an elegant way?</h4>
                    <p>This week we were asked to write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.</p>

                    <p>This part of the exercise was relatively straightforward and I used a for loop and the % operator to assign string elements to the code if the conditions were true (if the number was divisible by 3 or 5). Then we were asked to modify the program to print "FizzBuzz", for numbers that are divisible by both 3 AND 5 and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those. And I was completely stuck on how to do this. I tried a couple of techniques, like trial and error (mostly got errors) and I re-read the material we had been given in preparation for the exercise. I knew the answer to the exercise was provided in the following page, so in the end I looked ahead to find the answer.</p>

                    <h4>What did you learn?</h4>
                    <p>The second version of the program was really clever. The simple way is to add another “branch” to precisely test the given condition. This involved build up a string containing the word or words to output (fizz, buzz, fizzbuzz) and print either this word or the number if there is no word, by making use of the || operator.</p>

                    <p>The problem with this solution is that I saw the correct code and thought 'oh yep, that makes sense' but I didn't actually learn anything. So afterward, I wrote out the code again and again on my own until I was able to confidently write the program without any prompts. I used pseudocode  to write it out, used rubby ducky method to practice explaining it to someone else and made notes on using the || operator for future reference. I thought I would use this week's blog to write out the learning process involved as way of reflective learning practice.</p>
