What a responsive site is, and why responsiveness is important.
A responsive website is adjustable and flexible. It will have one code but the code is written is such a way that it changes in response to screen size.  This is great because it means the code will work and the page will be asthetic regardless of the screen size the user is on.  A site designed with responsive web design adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries

The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points. Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on, most commonly the width of the browser.

Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic. Therefore Google announced Mobilegeddon (April 21, 2015) and started to boost the ratings of sites that are mobile friendly if the search was made from a mobile device. This has the net effect of penalizing sites that are not mobile friendly.

What mobile first design is, and why it's important.
The great thing about this approach is it forces you into a content hierarchy. The most important piece of content is on top, followed by the next, followed by the next. Unlike a desktop approach where you can put two pieces of content side by side for equal footing, a mobile approach means one is above the other.

Mobile first design gets content to work well in a small screen first. It has a linear approach, with the most important content on the top. It is content hirearchy, unlike a desktop approach where you can put two pieces of content side by side. This makes sense when we think about a house analogy. Imagine you live in an apartment vs a house. One way movement/process is easier (moving from an aparemnt to a house) is easier than the other way (moving from house to an apartment). Its a lot harder to take a lot of stuff and put it in a small space than the other way around.

What frameworks are, and their pros and cons.
Instead of reinventing the wheel frameworks provide a standarised set of concepts and practices for dealing with a common type of problem. For example - there are frameworks for dealing with the common problem of building a responsive website that is easy. Freamwork for resposive prototype to design code that works at different sites.

What a wireframe is and why we use it.
Wireframe i s sketch of your website. A basic visual represenation of elements on a website. And an important step in any screen design process.
We use it to
1) establish hireachy
2) simplify communication (between you and the client)
3) provides a blueprint to use for design
