                    <h4>What is a responsive site and why is respnsive design important?</h4>
                    <p>A responsive website is adjustable and flexible. It will have one code but the code is written in such a way that it changes in response to screen size.  This is great because it means the code will work and the page will be asthetic regardless of the device it is being viewed on. A site designed with responsive principles adapts the layout to the viewing environment by using fluid, proportion-based grids, flexible images, and CSS3 media queries.</p>

                    <p>The fluid grid concept calls for page element sizing to be in relative units like percentages, rather than absolute units like pixels or points. Media queries allow the page to use different CSS style rules based on characteristics of the device the site is being displayed on, most commonly the width of the browser.</p>

                    <p>Responsive web design has become more important as the amount of mobile traffic now accounts for more than half of total internet traffic. Google announced Mobilegeddon (April 21, 2015) and started to boost the ratings of sites that are mobile friendly if the search was made from a mobile device. This has the net effect of penalizing sites that are not mobile friendly.</p>

                    <h4>What mobile first design is, and why it's important</h4>
                    <p>The great thing about this approach is it forces you into a content hierarchy. The most important piece of content is on top, followed by the next, followed by the next. Unlike a desktop approach where you can put two pieces of content side by side for equal footing, a mobile approach means one is above the other.</p>

                    <p>Mobile first design gets content to work well in a small screen first. It has a linear approach, with the most important content on the top. This makes sense when we think about a house analogy. Imagine you live in an apartment vs a house. Moving from an aparemnt to a house is easier than moving from house to an apartment). Its a lot harder to take a lot of stuff and put it in a small space than the other way around. That is why developers write the code for mobile sites first, and then build on the code as the screen size increases.</p>

                    <h4>What are frameworks? What are their pros and cons?</h4>
                    <p>Instead of reinventing the wheel frameworks provide a standarised set of concepts and practices for dealing with a common type of problem. For example - there are frameworks for dealing with the common problem of building a responsive website that is easy to adjust and use.</p>

                    <h4>What a wireframe is and why we use it</h4>
                    <p>Wireframe is a sketch of your website. A basic visual represenation of elements on a website. It is an important step in any screen design process</p>

                    <ul>We use wireframes to:
                        <ul>establish hireachy</ul>
                        <ul>simplify communication (between you and the client)</ul>
                        <ul>provide a blueprint to use for design</ul>
                    </ul>
