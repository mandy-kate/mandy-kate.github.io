                    <h4>What learnings did you take from the chapter?</h4>

                    <p>The first chapter provides an overview of the theory and brain science behind mindfulness. It introduces the concept of emotional intelligence (EQ). Which can be broadly defined as the ability to monitor your own (and others) feelings and emotions, to discriminate among them and to use this information to guide your thinking and behavior. </p>

                    The book argues that a strong, stable, and perceptive attention - that allows calmness and clarity - is the foundation upon which emotional intelligence is built.

                    To quote Viktor Frankl<span class="italic">“Between stimulus and response, there is a space. In that space lies our freedom and our power to choose our response. In our response lies our growth and our happiness.” What a mind of calmness and clarity does is to increase that space for us.”</span>

                    <p>The good news is that emotional intelligence can be acquired through training and practice. The idea that attention and emotional intelligence can be learned is based on a fairly new branch of science known as neuroplasticity. Neuroplasticity is that what we think, do, and pay attention to changes the structure and function of our brains. A famous example used widely when talking about neuroplasticity is that the part of the brain associated with memory and spatial navigation, the hippocampus, is bigger and more active in London cab drivers than in the average person. More interestingly, the longer someone has been driving a cab in London, the larger and more active their hippocampus.</p>

                    <p>Another important part of our brain is the basal ganglia which is linked to our intuition - it tells us what is right or wrong as a gut feeling. It can't tell us in words. Our bodies react to situations on a physiological level (sweaty palms during stress for example). Mindfulness can make it easier to notice subtle physiological changes in our body, simply because we are more aware of what is happening in the present moment.</p>

                    <h4>Bringing it all together</h4>
                    <p>The books first chapter introduces scientific evidence that demonstrates improving our ability to regulate our attention can significantly impact how we respond to emotions.</p>

                    <p>This is a great time to be reminded of neuroplasticity - I'm relying on it!</p>
