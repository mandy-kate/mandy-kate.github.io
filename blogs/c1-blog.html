	<h2>Reflection on Shereef's Fireside Chat</h2>

	<p>Enjoy Sheree's Fireside Chat. I can definitely appreciate the kitchen/creator mentality and being in this together all learning. I value the diversity of the cohort and I appreciate the tension that our teachers are going to experience as they determine what speed to teach at.
