	<h2>Week One Thoughts</h2>

	<h3>What's your take on EDA experience? What are your impressions?</h3>

	<p> The first week for me has been awesome, but also challenging. I enjoyed listening to Sheree's Fireside Chat; I thought it provided a good insight into the culture at EDA. I like the kitchen/creator mentality and it's good to be concious of this early in the course as I imagine it can be easy to slip out of this mindset - especially during times of stress. It's reassuring for me to think of our cohort as a team and being in this together. I value the diversity of the group and the learning opportunities that will come out of it. I appreciate the productive tension that the EDA teachers are going to experience as they determine what speed to teach at. I look forward to discovering new abilities and contributing to the group. 
	</p>

	<h3>Are you excited to participate in the learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h3>

	<p>I am definitely excited to be at EDA. It seems to me like a great balance of challenge and enjoyment. Of course, I am completely nervous about the challenge aspect. I'm nervous I will slip behind or not understand enough material. To mitigate this risk I plan to put the time in and push myself.
