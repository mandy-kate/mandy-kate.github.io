	<h3>Week One Thoughts</h3>

	<h2>What's your take on EDA experience? What are your impressions?</h2>

	<p> I enjoyed listening to Sheree's Fireside Chat. I can relate to the kitchen/creator mentality and being in this together as a cohort. I value the diversity of the cohort and the different learning opportunities it present. I appreciate the tension that our EDA teachers are going to experience as they determine what speed to teach at! I look forward to discovering my strenght and making contribution to the group. 
	</p>

	<h2>Are you excited to participate in the learning environment? Does it make you nervous?</h2>

	<p>I am definitely excited to be at EDA. It seems to me like a great balance of challenge and enjoyment. Of course, I am completely nervous about the challenge aspect! I'm nervous I will slip behind or not understand enough material. To mitigate this risk I plan to put the time in and push myself.
