            <h2>Can you think of an analogy to describe HTML, CSS and the DOM? How would you describe it to a non technical friend?</h2>
            <p>The house analogy is a well knonwn and simple way to explain the relationship between HTML, CSS and DOM (document object model). Say you are building a house, the HTML is the house footprint. Each has house an entrance, kitchen, hallway and bedrooms. Similarly each HTML footprint has a head, title, body and divs (sections within the body). CSS is used to design, style and position the house components. CSS will determine how the big the rooms are, their position in relation to each other, what colour the walls will be etc. You can apply CSS style rules to one room, or the whole house. The DOM is the platform used to present and interact with objects in HTLM. Keeping with the house analogy - the DOM would be the platform that is used by an architecture firm to present (and interact with) the house components, layout and design.

            <h2>What is meant by boxifying design?</h2>
            <p>Everything you see on a webpage is in a box. As a web designer this is helpful because when you think of a web page as being made up of a series of boxes - you literally can break down a page into boxes and focus on designing one element (one box) at a time. It gets complicated though, because you can have boxes within boxes within boxes! Espeically if you don't want a boring looking webpage (like this one!)

        <div class="question-three">
            <h2>What is the box model?</h2>
            <p>The box model considers each and every HTML element within a box. Each box consists of margins, borders, padding and the actual content. The relationship between the four elements of a box (margin, border, padding and content) can be defined using CSS (the styling language referred to above).
