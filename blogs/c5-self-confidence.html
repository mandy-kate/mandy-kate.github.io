                    <h4> What is the relationship between mindfulness and self awareness?</h4>
                    <p> Mindfulness means paying attention in a particular way: on purpose, in the preent moment, and non-judgementally. Where as self-awareness is a neutral mode that maintains self-reflectiveness even in the midst of chaos and/or times of stress</p>

                    <p>This weeks chapter argues that self awareness is the key domain of emotional intelligence. Our enagement in self-awareness is a necessary step in gaining control over our emoional lives. The book uses a metaphor to describe this:</p>

                    <p><div id = quote><em>"The moment you see a raging river, it means you are already rising above it"</em></div></p>

                    <p>Similarly, the moment you see an emotion, you are no longer fully engulfed in it or by it. The chapter moves on to talk about self confidnece - more specficially the self-knowledge and blatant self-honesty needed for sustainable self-confidence. This means having nothing to hide from oneself and it comes from accurate self-assessment. If we can assess ourselves accurately, we can clearly and objectively see our greatest strengths and our biggest weaknesses. We become honest to ourselves about our aspirations and desires. We learn about our prioritieis in life, what is important to us, and what is not important that we can let go. We want to reach a point where we are comfortable in our own skins and there are no skeletons in our closets we do not already know about.</p>
