                    <h4>How does JavaScript compare to HTML and CSS?</h4>
                    <p>The web page you see in your browser may be a combination of structure, style and interactivity.
                    These jobs are undertaken by three different technologies, HTML, Javascript, and CSS which your browser knows how to interpret.

                    A web page may combine structure from HTML, style from CSS and functionality from JavaScript.

                    HTML marks the content up into different structural types, like paragraphs, blocks, lists, images, tables, forms, comments etc.

                    CSS tells the browser how each type of element should be displayed, which may vary for different media (like screen, print or handheld device)

                    JavaScript tells the browser how to change the web page in response to events that happen (like clicking on something, or changing the value in a form).

                    Most important thing; keep HTML, CSS and JavaScript code seperate. JavaScript is a dynamic lanugage. When we want to do more than just click through a page. Instead we want to play a game or scroll around on a map. Basically so that you can have more meaningful real-time interactions. For example, if you are filling out an online form and hit the “submit” button, the web page can use JavaScript to check your entries in real-time and alert you almost instantly if you had filled out the form incorrectly.</p>

                    <h4>Explain control flow and loops using an example process from everyday life, for example 'waking up' or 'brushing your teeth'</h4>
                    <p>Control flow is the order in which iindividual statements, instructions or function calls of a program are executed or evaluated. For example, you would get out of bed before having a shower. You would shower before getting dressed.</p>

                    <p>Loops are used to repeat an action until conditions are met. They execute a block of code a number of times. For example, keep putting clothes on until you're dressed. Or keep brushing your teeth until time = 2 minutes. </p>

                    <h4>Explain the difference between accessing data from arrays and object literals</h4>
                    <p>We access data from arrays using bracket notation and numbers. For example myArray[2]. Array's are zero-indexed so myArray[2] retrieves the third element of the array. First element is [0], second element is [1] </p>

                    <p>We access data from object literals using dot notation. For example, myObject.name retrieves the name of the object. Objects allow more variables to be stored and objects can consist of several arrays. </p>

                    <h4>Explain what functions are and why they are useful</h4>
                    <p>A function is a block of code designed to perform a particular task. It is run (executve) when it is called. An easy way to think about functions is like baking a cake. The main process stays the same (combine ingredients, mix, bake in over). Each time you make a cake you preform these tasks but there are different inputs each time. Each cake has different ingredients, for example, or a differnt time in the oven.</p>
