                    <h4>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? What worked for you?</h4>
                    <p> I tried the Pomodoro technique which worked well especially with planning and tracking progress of specific tasks and being able to work on one thing at a time. In the past I have tended to move a lot between tasks. It will be a challenge to break this habit as it is behavior that has been rewarded in previous jobs. In the past I have been required to juggle multiple tasks at the same time.</p>

                    <h4>What time and habit management techniques will you experiment further with?</h4>
                    <p>I will continue practising pomodoro technique and fogg method. I like the fogg method principle of making small incremental changes over time. Meaning there is no pressure for immediate or major change. I plan to set time aside to reflect on processing all this new information properly - not just rope learning - will lead to better outcomes for sure. I practice yoga reguarly as a way to unwind - and will continue to do so throughout the bootcamp. I really like that yoga and mediatation is actively encouraged through EDA. </p>
