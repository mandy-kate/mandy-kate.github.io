	<h2>Which timebox and habits techniques did you try? What worked for you?</h2>

	<p> I tried the Pomodoro technique which worked well especially with planning and tracking progress of specific tasks and being able to work on one thing at a time. In the past I have tended to move a lot between tasks quite quickly. It will be a challenge to break this habit as it is behavior that has been rewarded in previous jobs where I am required to juggle multiple tasks at the same time.

	<h2>What time and habit management techniques will you experiment further with?</h2>

	<p>I will continue practising pomodoro technique and fogg method. The fogg method principle of making small incremental changes over time sits well with me. Instead of making yourself go through a huge major change! I plan to set time aside to reflect on learning and practice as processing all this information - not just rope learning - will lead to more learning for sure. I practice yoga reguarly and will continue to do so. I am stoked it goes hand in hand with the learning style at EDA. </p>
