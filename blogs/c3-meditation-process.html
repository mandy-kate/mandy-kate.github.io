                 <h4>What new things have you learnt about mediation?</h4>
                 <p>There is nothing mysterious about meditation. It’s really just mental training. Here is an analogy. Imagine you have a pot of water full of sediments, and imagine that pot is constantly shaken and agitated. The water appears cloudy. Imagine that you stop agitating the pot and just let it rest on the floor. The water will become calm and, after a while, all the sediments will settle and the water will appear clear. This is the classical analogy of the mind in the alert and relaxed state. In this state, we temporarily stop agitating the mind until eventually, our mind becomes calm and clear, the same way the water appears calm and clear.</p>

                 <p>Mindfulness mediation has three elements; intention, movement and sensation. Many studies demonstrate that the amount of time spent on mindfulness meditation can improve happiness and increase immunity. Research has shown an participants who practiced mindfullness mediation regularly for six weeks could operate more effectively at work. The reason for this is thought to be because of increased attentional ability. So mediation practitioners are able to proces stimuli more effectively. Hi effectiveness in processing and responding to stiumuli - an increase in memory, learning and perception.</p>

                 <h4> Did any of the suggested mediation techniques stand out to you?</h4>
                 <p>It is remarkable that mindfulness helps improve everything from attention and brain function to immunity and skin disease. Mindfulness feels almost like MacGyver’s Swiss Army knife—it is useful in every situation. Mindfulness meditation is a key tool in developing emotional intelligence</p>
