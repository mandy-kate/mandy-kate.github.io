                    <h4>What did you learn from this chapter?</h4>
                    <p>With training, a calm and clear mind can be called on demand. And there are ways to extend mindfulness into every aspect of our daily lives. The challenge is to generalize mindfulness into life situations outside formal sitting meditation. </p>

                    <h4>Which of the three suggested techniques will you use to sustain your practice?</h4>
                    <p>Practice listening without an intention to respond. This is giving the gift of full attention to the speaker. Looping helps to close the loop of communication by demonstrating that you have really heard what the person is saying. This isn't about trying to remember everything someone has said: if you really listen, you will hear. Part of the practice is becoming able to give full attention, with full awareness of your own response. </p>

                    <p>Mindfulness meditation practice should feel like an indulgence not a chore. So do not sit for so long that it becomes burdensome. Sit often, for short periods. </p>

                    <p>We can think of mindfullness like having peripheral vision. When we are looking at something, we have central vision and peripheral vision. We can see the chosen object clearly (with central vision), and at the same time, we have a visual sense of what is around it (using peripheral vision). Similarly, we can think of our attention as having a central component and a peripheral component, so we can give our central attention to something and we still maintain a peripheral attention to ourselves and our response. </p>
